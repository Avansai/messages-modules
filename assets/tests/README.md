# Writing Tests

To write tests yoo can create a new TypeScript file accompanied with it's messages files and verify that the output of the plugin is as expected.

A useful tool to use when parsing these file is the [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/) that can help you view how the code is parsed by the plugin.
